# I ❤️ Web

That's a small project that tests the knowledge on the Web platform. Go to [https://iloveweb.dev/](https://iloveweb.dev/) and try it yourself.

# Contribution

1. Check out the repository
2. Navigate to the `site` directory and run `yarn` followed by `yarn dev`
3. Open http://localhost:8080/ or http://localhost:8080/?q={file name} (To see the available files go to [./site/lib/public/questions](./site/lib/public/questions))
4. Check if there is a file that you can contribute to or create a new one. Add your questions. (The only one that you should not touch is `__all__.js`)

Check out the questions that already exists in [./site/lib/public/questions](./site/lib/public/questions). You'll get an idea how to write a new one.

Here're some tips:

* If you want to see a single question in a file add `only: true` to it and load that specific file. For example http://localhost:8080/?q=html.js
* If you need to escape some code so you can add it to the text of the question go [here](https://daskalo.dev/escape).
